# faces.py
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Facial recognision program which takes a given set of images, answers to the
# images and a test as arguments. It then uses Back-propagation with 4 synapses
# to traing on a given set of images. It does this with a sigmoid function
# which it later on used to test the image and compares it with a given answer
# and returns the error. Then it runs the testing and prints the answers.
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Usage: python faces.py <training.txt> <training_keys.txt> <test.txt>
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# INPUT: training.txt: file with n nr of images following this format: First
#           Image name, then a 20x20 image with numbers ranging from 1 to 32.
#        training_keys.txt: file with n nr of answers to the images of the
#           format: Image name then answer
#        test.txt: same as training.txt
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
# OUTPUT: Prints to STDOUT in this format
#    Image1 2
#    Image2 3
#    Image3 1
