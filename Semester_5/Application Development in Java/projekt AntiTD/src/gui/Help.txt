 troops to the "G" marked tiles on the map.

G = Troop goal

To spawn troops, press the buttons on the bottom to spawn a corrisponding troop.

If several spawns are available, you may choose which one to use by clicking on it,
 a dashed yellow circle is shown on an active spawn.

Credits are used to spawn troops, a sum is given to
 you at start and more is given during the game,
 the banker troop will increase the given amount while on the field.

You can see information such as cost and health about each troop directly to the left.

If there are T-junction and/or crossroads present on the map,
 an arrow will indicate which direction troops will take when passing it,
 you can change this direction by clicking on the corrisponding tile.

Areas marked with a green plus will any troops passing by.

Some parts of the waterway may have blue arrows on them, and will give your troops some extra speed.
